# steepest-descent-method-project
Solution for an assignment of Operations Research course. The objective is to find local minimum of a function of two variables which is in the form of &Sigma;cx<sub>1</sub><sup>a</sup>x<sub>2</sub><sup>b</sup>, using the [steepest descent method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_steepest_descent).

The function and the initial point is inside the source file.  Program prints result of each iteration to the standard output.
